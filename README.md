<h1>HR Dashboard</h1>

## Project Overview

HR Dashboard is a modern, responsive frontend web application built using React, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI.

This dashboard mimics a Human Resource Management interface, where users can:

- View a list of employees (user cards)
- Bookmark/unbookmark employees they want to keep track of
- View detailed user profiles via dynamic routing
- Switch between visual themes like Light, Dark.

The application uses **Zustand** for global state management (bookmarks), and **React Router** for client-side navigation.  
Itâ€™s designed to be clean, fast, and fully responsive across devices. While there is no backend integration, dummy data is used to simulate a real-world scenario.

This project is perfect for learning or demonstrating:

- Component-based architecture
- State management
- UI theming and styling using utility classes
- Clean code organization in a React application

## Features

- View detailed employee information (image, name, location, etc.)
- Bookmark or unbookmark users using a single click
- Toggle between Light, Dark, and Synthwave themes (DaisyUI)
- Fully responsive design across desktop and mobile
- Fast routing with `react-router-dom` (View Details page)
- Global state management using Zustand for bookmarks
- Clean and modern UI with Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI components
